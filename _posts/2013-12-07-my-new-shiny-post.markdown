title: Is npm worth $2.6MM?

Yesterday, npm, Inc. announced that it had closed a $2.6MM round of funding. This was met with a bunch of derision on Twitter. I feel this is not only unwarranted, but backwards: I think this investment signals a nascent trend within the VC community, and a more honest view of how open source actually works.

Disclaimer: I’m just some random dude. I don’t have any privileged information about this investment or any of the others I’ll discuss in this post. I haven’t talked to any VCs to actually see if this is what they’re doing, and if I tried, they probably wouldn’t tell me anyway. That said, it doesn’t really matter: what they do is more important than what they intend.

Further disclaimer: I work for a company which has received investment...
